# Reverse Shell
### This project is the implemetaion of reverse shell using MQTT protocol.

## Why MQTT?
	* Can be accessed without the having of Public IP
	* Easy to implement
	* Light Weight
	* Multiple host can control multiple targets simultaneously
	* `QOS = 2` can ensure no loss of data midway
	* Cross platform, basically any machine which can run Python 



## Things to do
	* Implementation of Change of Directory (CD) command
	* Making of Subscriber(Target Side Code) more robust
	* Making host terminal more user friendly and interactive


### All the codes are implemnted in python3 and are not tested for python2
